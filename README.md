# Classify CIFAR Images

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for image classification tasks. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

## Dataset Files

The CIFAR-10 dataset is provided as a collection of files in a specific directory. Here is an overview of the dataset files:

- `data_batch_1`, `data_batch_2`, ..., `data_batch_5`: These files contain the training images and their corresponding labels. Each file represents a different batch of training data.

- `test_batch`: This file contains the test images and their labels. It is used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models.

- `batches.meta`: This file contains additional metadata about the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes information such as the label names corresponding to different classes in the dataset.

## Code Overview

The code provided demonstrates how to load the CIFAR-10 dataset into memory using Python. It uses the `pickle` module to deserialize the dataset files.

The code snippet performs the following steps:

1. Load the training images and labels:
   - It iterates over the training batch files (`data_batch_1`, `data_batch_2`, etc.).
   - Each batch file is opened and its contents are loaded using `pickle.load()`.
   - The image data is appended to the `train_images` list, and the labels are extended into the `train_labels` list.

2. Load the test images and labels:
   - The `test_batch` file is opened and its contents are loaded using `pickle.load()`.
   - The test images are assigned to the `test_images` variable, and the test labels are assigned to the `test_labels` variable.

3. Convert the data to NumPy arrays:
   - The `train_images`, `train_labels`, `test_images`, and `test_labels` lists are converted to NumPy arrays for further processing.

4. Reshape the image data:
   - The image data is reshaped from a flat shape to a 4D shape `(num_samples, height, width, channels)`.
   - The dimensions are rearranged to match the convention used by TensorFlow and Keras.

## Network Architecture

The network used for training the CIFAR-10 dataset consists of the following layers:

1. Convolutional Layer: Applies a set of filters to the input image to extract features. The output of this layer is a feature map.
2. Activation Function: Applies a non-linear activation function (such as ReLU) to introduce non-linearity into the model.
3. Max Pooling Layer: Performs downsampling to reduce the spatial dimensions of the input and extract the most important features.
4. Convolutional Layer: Another convolutional layer to further extract features from the downsampled feature maps.
5. Activation Function: Another activation function to introduce non-linearity.
6. Max Pooling Layer: Another max pooling layer for downsampling.
7. Fully Connected Layer: Performs a matrix multiplication on the input data to learn complex patterns and relationships.
8. Activation Function: Another activation function to introduce non-linearity.
9. Fully Connected Layer: Another fully connected layer with dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.
10. Output Layer: Produces the final class probabilities using a softmax activation function.

## Training

To train a model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, you can use the following steps:

1. Define the network architecture by configuring the layers, activation

 functions, and output layer.

2. Set up the training parameters such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

3. Implement the training loop:
   - Iterate over the training data in batches.
   - Forward pass: Pass the batch of images through the network and compute the predicted labels.
   - Calculate the loss between the predicted labels and the ground truth labels.
   - Backward pass: Compute the gradients of the network parameters with respect to the loss.
   - Update the network parameters using an optimization algorithm (e.g., stochastic gradient descent).

4. Evaluate the model periodically on the test dataset to monitor its performance and avoid overfitting.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the trained model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, you can use the following steps:

1. Load the trained model from disk.

2. Pass the test images through the network and compute the predicted labels.

3. Compare the predicted labels with the ground truth labels to calculate the accuracy of the model.

4. Optionally, you can visualize the model's predictions and performance metrics to gain insights into its behavior.

Feel free to modify the code as needed and preprocess the data according to your requirements before using it for training or evaluation. You can also experiment with different network architectures, training parameters, and evaluation techniques to improve the performance of your model.
